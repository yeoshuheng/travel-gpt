# TravelGPT
Your one-stop travel buddy app build for the lazy tourists.
Build for SIA Application Challenge under the Generative AI category.

### Introduction
Currently travel guides on SIA websites are lacking in locations, with very little information on them. It is however unrealistic for SIA to be able to provide handy travel guides for every location.
As tourists, it is also very cumbersome to gather information across various sources, hence we wanted a one-stop solution for everything from itinerary recommendations to weather forecasts.
With that, we have decided to leverage on the growing trend of free to use LLMs such as chatGPT to help tourists generate recommendations and gather related information.

### Tools
